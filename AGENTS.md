# T560 Workspace Guide

This repository is the source for `t560`.

## Safety
- Keep self-protection enabled.
- Do not delete or rename protected runtime paths.
- Prefer targeted edits over broad rewrites.

## Editing
- Read full files before major changes.
- Use existing project patterns and naming.
- Keep changes minimal and test after editing.

## Prompt Context Files
The dashboard and runtime expect these workspace bootstrap files to exist:
- `AGENTS.md`
- `SOUL.md`
- `TOOLS.md`
- `IDENTITY.md`
- `USER.md`
- `HEARTBEAT.md`
- `BOOTSTRAP.md`
