# Telegram (Bot API)

Status: production-ready for bot DMs + groups via grammY. Long polling is the default mode; webhook mode is optional.

## Quick setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the bot token in BotFather">
    Open Telegram and chat with **@BotFather** (confirm the handle is exactly `@BotFather`).

    Run `/newbot`, follow prompts, and save the token.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure token and DM policy">

```json5
{
  channels: {
    telegram: {
      enabled: true,
      botToken: "123:abc",
      dmPolicy: "pairing",
      groups: { "*": { requireMention: true } },
    },
  },
}
```

    Env fallback: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...` (default account only).

  </Step>

  <Step title="Start gateway and approve first DM">

```bash
t560 gateway
t560 pairing list telegram
t560 pairing approve telegram <CODE>
```

    Pairing codes expire after 1 hour.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the bot to a group">
    Add the bot to your group, then set `channels.telegram.groups` and `groupPolicy` to match your access model.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Token resolution order is account-aware. In practice, config values win over env fallback, and `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` only applies to the default account.
</Note>

## Telegram side settings

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Privacy mode and group visibility">
    Telegram bots default to **Privacy Mode**, which limits what group messages they receive.

    If the bot must see all group messages, either:

    - disable privacy mode via `/setprivacy`, or
    - make the bot a group admin.

    When toggling privacy mode, remove + re-add the bot in each group so Telegram applies the change.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Group permissions">
    Admin status is controlled in Telegram group settings.

    Admin bots receive all group messages, which is useful for always-on group behavior.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Helpful BotFather toggles">

    - `/setjoingroups` to allow/deny group adds
    - `/setprivacy` for group visibility behavior

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Access control and activation

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="DM policy">
    `channels.telegram.dmPolicy` controls direct message access:

    - `pairing` (default)
    - `allowlist`
    - `open` (requires `allowFrom` to include `"*"`)
    - `disabled`

    `channels.telegram.allowFrom` accepts numeric Telegram user IDs. `telegram:` / `tg:` prefixes are accepted and normalized.
    The onboarding wizard accepts `@username` input and resolves it to numeric IDs.
    If you upgraded and your config contains `@username` allowlist entries, run `t560 doctor --fix` to resolve them (best-effort; requires a Telegram bot token).

    ### Finding your Telegram user ID

    Safer (no third-party bot):

    1. DM your bot.
    2. Run `t560 logs --follow`.
    3. Read `from.id`.

    Official Bot API method:

```bash
curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<bot_token>/getUpdates"
```

    Third-party method (less private): `@userinfobot` or `@getidsbot`.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Group policy and allowlists">
    There are two independent controls:

    1. **Which groups are allowed** (`channels.telegram.groups`)
       - no `groups` config: all groups allowed
       - `groups` configured: acts as allowlist (explicit IDs or `"*"`)

    2. **Which senders are allowed in groups** (`channels.telegram.groupPolicy`)
       - `open`
       - `allowlist` (default)
       - `disabled`

    `groupAllowFrom` is used for group sender filtering. If not set, Telegram falls back to `allowFrom`.
    `groupAllowFrom` entries must be numeric Telegram user IDs.

    Example: allow any member in one specific group:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    telegram: {
      groups: {
        "-1001234567890": {
          groupPolicy: "open",
          requireMention: false,
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Mention behavior">
    Group replies require mention by default.

    Mention can come from:

    - native `@botusername` mention, or
    - mention patterns in:
      - `agents.list[].groupChat.mentionPatterns`
      - `messages.groupChat.mentionPatterns`

    Session-level command toggles:

    - `/activation always`
    - `/activation mention`

    These update session state only. Use config for persistence.

    Persistent config example:

```json5
{
  channels: {
    telegram: {
      groups: {
        "*": { requireMention: false },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

    Getting the group chat ID:

    - forward a group message to `@userinfobot` / `@getidsbot`
    - or read `chat.id` from `t560 logs --follow`
    - or inspect Bot API `getUpdates`

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Runtime behavior

- Telegram is owned by the gateway process.
- Routing is deterministic: Telegram inbound replies back to Telegram (the model does not pick channels).
- Inbound messages normalize into the shared channel envelope with reply metadata and media placeholders.
- Group sessions are isolated by group ID. Forum topics append `:topic:<threadId>` to keep topics isolated.
- DM messages can carry `message_thread_id`; T560 routes them with thread-aware session keys and preserves thread ID for replies.
- Long polling uses grammY runner with per-chat/per-thread sequencing. Overall runner sink concurrency uses `agents.defaults.maxConcurrent`.
- Telegram Bot API has no read-receipt support (`sendReadReceipts` does not apply).

## Feature reference

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Live stream preview (message edits)">
    T560 can stream partial replies by sending a temporary Telegram message and editing it as text arrives.

    Requirement:

    - `channels.telegram.streamMode` is not `"off"` (default: `"partial"`)

    Modes:

    - `off`: no live preview
    - `partial`: frequent preview updates from partial text
    - `block`: chunked preview updates using `channels.telegram.draftChunk`

    `draftChunk` defaults for `streamMode: "block"`:

    - `minChars: 200`
    - `maxChars: 800`
    - `breakPreference: "paragraph"`

    `maxChars` is clamped by `channels.telegram.textChunkLimit`.

    This works in direct chats and groups/topics.

    For text-only replies, T560 keeps the same preview message and performs a final edit in place (no second message).

    For complex replies (for example media payloads), T560 falls back to normal final delivery and then cleans up the preview message.

    `streamMode` is separate from block streaming. When block streaming is explicitly enabled for Telegram, T560 skips the preview stream to avoid double-streaming.

    Telegram-only reasoning stream:

    - `/reasoning stream` sends reasoning to the live preview while generating
    - final answer is sent without reasoning text
